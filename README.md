# Updater for AppImage (provisional name)
An AppImage Updater-wannabe. Written in Python and AppJar (GUI).

## Future Features
- [x] Posibility to change the folder where the AppImages are.
- [x] Check is the AppImageUpdater is on Apps Folder, if not, download and
    chmod it.
- [ ] 2 Tabs, one to list ALL the AppImages and the other one just for the AppImages with update available.

## Todo
- [ ] A new style for the GUI, a more "modern look".
- [x] Delete that awful statusbar (just for development).
